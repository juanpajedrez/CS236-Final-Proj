### Project Description
In the medical field, there has been a growing demand for multi-classification systems capable of predicting medical diagnoses based on doctors' notes or medical images. Ensuring the reliability of these systems has been a priority in recent years, driven by advancements in deep learning and machine learning.

This repository contains files utilizing Generative AI architectures, specifically Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), to accomplish the following:
- Develop a generative classifier capable of detecting medical pathologies (such as effusion, pneumonia, pneumothorax) based on chest X-ray images.
- Create a generative model using VAE architecture to produce high-quality synthetic chest X-ray images.
